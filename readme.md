# Baseball Team Stats Case Study

## Project Overview
This Excel project analyzes historical Major League Baseball (MLB) team performance data, using PivotTables, PivotCharts, and slicers to visualize trends, league comparisons, postseason success patterns, and changes in power hitting over time. The goal is to showcase advanced Excel analytical capabilities — from structuring and cleaning sports data to building an interactive and insight-rich dashboard.

## Objectives
- Import and prepare historical MLB team performance data.
- Build PivotTables to summarize league and team statistics.
- Create PivotCharts to visualize performance trends.
- Use slicers for interactive filtering by league and team.
- Highlight postseason success and power-hitting patterns.
